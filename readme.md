## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my attempt at an educational just-for-fun rewrite of React, chiefly to observe and create all the major components that make React such a popular and east-to-learn front-end library. I get that its not as optimized as React but its a given since it isn't for actual development either. The repo is very much in its inital stages, so all contributions are welcome.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Its fairly simple to get started and try out this library. Just clone the repo to your machine. I have already added the required babel configs to get things done. There is a `script.js` file in the src with a template snippet.

### Prerequisites

NodeJS and npm.

### Installing

Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/LogiqueClergyman/easyReact.git
```

Install dependencies. (its just babel)

```
npm i
```

Make changes to your script.js file and then build.

```
npm run build
```

Run the index.html file (prefer the VSCode Live Server extension to avoid JS errors due to browser restrictions).

## 🎉 Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>

- Hats off to Pomber and his [didact](https://github.com/pomber/didact) repo. I started out from there and am extending it in all possible directions.
